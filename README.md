CodeStock for iOS
=====

This is an unofficial iOS app for the [CodeStock](http://www.codestock.org) conference held in Knoxville, TN on June 15/16, 2012.  My main purpose with this app is to test out greenfield iOS 5 development & have a little fun building a new app.  It's very much a work in progress and will be for quite some time.  That being said, feel free to download and play around with it.
